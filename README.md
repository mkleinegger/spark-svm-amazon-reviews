# DIC - Exercise 2

This is our submission for the second exercise of the course "Data Intensive Computing". It consists of the following files important for grading:

- [notebook.ipynb](src/notebook.ipynb): The Jupyter notebook containing the solution to the tasks of the exercise.
- [output_rdd.txt](output_rdd.txt): The output of the RDD based solution.
- [output_ds.txt](output_ds.txt): The output of the Dataset/DataFrame based solution.
- [report.pdf](report.pdf): The report of the exercise.
- [evaluation.ipynb](src/evaluation.ipynb): The Jupyter notebook containing the evaluation of the solutions and the code to generate the plots.

Additionally, there are other files, like [output.txt](output.txt) and [grid_search_evaluation.csv](grid_search_evaluation.csv), which are outputs of the notebook and/or needed for the evaluation and the [stopwords.txt](data/stopwords.txt) file containing the stopwords used for filtering in the exercise.
